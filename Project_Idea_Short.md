# Project Idea: "Shared Dreams"

A collaborative web platform where users contribute dreams, fragments, or surreal moments they've experienced. Each contribution appears as a floating bubble in a 3D space. When bubbles touch, they merge temporarily, creating unexpected combinations of different people's subconscious imagery. Users can navigate this dreamscape, interact with bubbles to read/view the content, and watch as their dream slowly drifts and connects with others. Over time, the most frequently connected dreams form constellation patterns, revealing collective themes in our unconscious minds. The project explores how individual imagination intersects with shared human experiences, creating a living, breathing archive of our collective subconscious.

**Tech**: Three.js for 3D visualization, React for UI, Firebase for real-time data, simple text/image input.

**Timeline**: 6 weeks - Week 1-2: basic 3D scene and bubble system, Week 3-4: interaction and merging logic, Week 5-6: polish and pattern detection.
